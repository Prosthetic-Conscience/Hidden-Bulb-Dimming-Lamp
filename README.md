# Hidden-Bulb-Dimming-Lamp
This was a project to make a dimmable lamp with hidden wires and bulb, that could smoothly dim decorative large LED bulbs.
It utilizes the RobotDyne zero crossing dimmer module so a smooth brightness adjustment can be made using any LED bulb under 25 watts (circuitry can handle more, but the papyrus likely can't).

The lamp is made from spalted maple with bronze touchpad bars, and papyrus shades. While the bronze looks the best of all the options, it's also extremely hard, so cutting it is difficult, and as it can't be easily soldered drilling and tapping end blocks for ring terminals is a must, and the entire assemblage must be epoxied together.

The oversized 5VDC power supply was used to power a Qi charger as well as the arduino nano, but it interfered heavily with the MPR121 touch sensor so was unusable.
