# Hidden-Bulb-Dimming-Lamp
This was a project to make a dimmable lamp with hidden wires and bulb, that could smoothly dim decorative large LED bulbs
It utilizes the RobotDyne zero crossing dimmer module so a smooth brightness adjustment can be made using any LED bulb under 25 watts (circuitry can handle more, but the papyrus likely can't)

The oversized 5VDC power supply was used to power a Qi charger as well as the arduino nano, but it interfered heavily with the MPR121 touch sensor so was unusable.
